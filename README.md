# CEEP Services

For people residing in apartments/communities which are isolated from the city, it is difficult and time-consuming to get simple plumbing or carpentry work done. Hence this web application acts as a fast and viable option. In this application, the user can book the required service. The website also provides reviews and feedbacks of all the service providers for the user’s convenience. In our general life we have separate apps or websites for individual problems, so our intention is to combine all these services into a single platform.
